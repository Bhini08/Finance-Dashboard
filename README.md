Project Setup

Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your system.
- MongoDB for the database.
- Python and necessary machine learning libraries if not packaged.

 Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elevate-finance-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
